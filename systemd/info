Primarily used on my Ryzen 5 2500u based laptop, where amdgpu fails to resume from suspend if a compositor is running.
Thus this kills picom [compton] before going to suspend.

system-sleep folder is located at :
/usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/


##############
As of 25/05/2020 and v19.1.0-2 of amdgpu driver running on kernel 5.6.14, there is no need to kill the compositor before suspending
